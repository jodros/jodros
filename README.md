Hey folks, I'm an undergraduate student of literature, Portuguese and Russian languages at University of SÃ£o Paulo, but I'm also a free software enthusiast and always look over computer science and related stuff.

My professional interest is mostly in book publishing but I'm open to eventual jobs related to programming or giving classes.

I'm currently working on a [SILE](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile)-based project - [extend.sile](https://github.com/jodros/extend.sile).
